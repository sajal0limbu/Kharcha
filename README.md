An app that lets you track your expenses and write notes.
It is a simple app that i made in a week. It logs your expenses and provides a summary for your expenses with a sick ticker animation.
I made this app as a test for MVVM architechture and to learn about ROOM persistence library. 
I would like to add more features in the future.
